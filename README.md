# Hello there!

- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Umuthan!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making games and art.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity, Godot, 3D Design, 2D Art, webdev and more.
- ğŸ¤” You can see my work from [my website (under construction, do not enter for your own safety)](https://umuthanozel.com)
- ğŸ“« You can reach me at ozelumuthan@gmail.com

P.S. Majority of my personal repos are private due to being having close to no time, and work repos are, of course private, hence the low commit counts.
